# GameWithNoName

## Description

This is actually my first standalone game made with OpenGL. Thanks to Creepsy for helping with the game engine!

The game is an open-world sandbox game with low-poly graphics. The player can walk around and collect resources to make tool stations and build their own houses to attract NPC's (probably takes a while until this will be implemented).
We also try to make this game as realistic as possible (in terms of game mechanics).

Controls:
- **R** to open resource menu
- **S** to open settings menu

## Ideas / TODO's

- placeable buildings & assets
- player, moving around, collecting resources
- minecolonies-like?
- low-poly
- cube terrain

## Example Code

Some code snippets explaining every function of the rendering library. They are stored in the *example* folder.  
- *custom_window* explains how to create a custom window you can base an application on
- *mesh* explains how to use the different mesh types (textured and colored)

## Formatting Conventions

TODO!!!

**Class names:** ExampleClass  
**Function / method names:** exampleFunction  
**Variables names:** example_variable  
**Constants names:** EXAMPLE_CONSTANT
