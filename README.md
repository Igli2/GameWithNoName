# GameWithNoName

## Description

This is actually my first standalone game made with OpenGL. Thanks to Creepsy for helping with the game engine!

The game is an open-world sandbox game with low-poly graphics. The player can walk around and collect resources to make tool stations and build their own houses to attract NPC's (probably takes a while until this will be implemented).
We also try to make this game as realistic as possible (in terms of game mechanics).

## Ideas / TODO's

- placeable buildings & assets
- player, moving around, collecting resources
- minecolonies-like?
- low-poly
- cube terrain
- resource menu, building menu
